<p> <style="color: red;font-size:30"> Index page</p><br><p>  I worked for International Harvester/Navistar for forty years. A lot in their truck group.<br>  Since I saw a lot of their trucks on the road I took up a hobby to collect patches from common carriers, especially those that used International/Navistar Trucks. I am in the process of designing and coding a website to feature some of my "Trucking Industry Patch" collection as well as some other miscellaneous information about the Trucking Industry. Basically, there will be some general trucking industry information and then a section for company specific information.
  <br><br>Eventually there will be information on 3,000 Common Carriers (US and Canadian) and images of their patches.</p>
 <p> The appearance, display, and content will change as my skill set increases and monetary resources are available to grow the site.<br>
