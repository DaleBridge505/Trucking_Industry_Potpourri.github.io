<p> If you click on a letter the site will direct you to seperate page with patches from companies that have names that start with that letter.  
 <br>Check back frequently, as the patches I have availalbe vary based upon when I am able to acquire collections to use to add to my efforts.<br> I will usually trade two of my patches for one of your patches.  I already have over 7,000 diffeint patches in my project so don't be dissapoineted if I don't need yours.
  
 If you have any trucking patches to sell I am willing to help a bit with that.  I will list up to 10 patches for 60 days for you.  To do that please send an image of it, with the rough estimate of its size, or with a ruler image along one side.<br>
	I also need the price you want for it (include shipping cost in that price).  I also need contact information (email or phone number) so the buyer can work with you.  Do not send the patch to me, you need to work directly with the buyer to collect sale price and get shipping information.  Please contact me if you want my help, I will not charge you anything for this assistance.<br>
