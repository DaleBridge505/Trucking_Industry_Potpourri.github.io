<p> <style="color: red;font-size:30px"> More about this Website</p><br><p>  I worked for International Harvester/Navistar for forty years. A lot in their truck group.  Since I saw a lot of their trucks on the road I took up a hobby to collect patches from common carriers. I am in the process of designing and coding a website to feature some of my collection. Basically, there will be some general trucking industry information and then a section for company specific information.
  <br><br>Eventually there will be information on 6,000 Common Carriers (US and Canadian) and images of their patches.</p>
 <p> The appearance, display, and content will change as my skill set increases and monetary resources are available to grow the site.<br>
